This Personal Portfolio Website is a simple and responsive personal branding site built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a brief professional profile, technical skills (including programming languages, web technologies, and databases), and highlights academic or personal projects such as a calculator app and student record system. The site includes an About section with a profile card and image, a Skills section listing key abilities, and a Contact section with a form for collaboration or job opportunities. Designed for clarity and clean presentation, it serves as a digital resume and a central hub for potential recruiters or collaborators to learn more and get in touch.
